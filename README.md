# Research Methodology for Industrial Design: Assignment Experiments
This repo contains all the information for the assignment, which is inspired on [Therms-Up!: DIY Inflatables and Interactive Materials by Upcycling Wasted Thermoplastic Bags](https://github.com/mallcong/Therms-Up/).
The goal of the assignment is to develop an experimental design, execute this, analyse this, and interpret this in a meaningfull way (defenitely take a look at the Evaluation_Result section of the Therms-Up GitHub). 

### 1. Develop an experimental design
- [ ] which are your dependent and independent variables?
- [ ] which are your hypothesis?
- [ ] what is your sample size?

### 2. Develop floatable artefacts
- [ ] design patterns (include a place for the tube!) (inspiration: see starter section on the Therms-Up Github)
- [ ] test the template on a sample
- [ ] how? See **creating floatables**
- [ ] produce the required amount of floatables according to you research design

### 3. Build the test set-up
- [ ] Set-up your Arduino Nano and the rest of the hardware following **this schematic**
- [ ] Plug in you Arduino and upload **this sketch**
- [ ] Check if pressure is detected using the Serial Plotter in the Arduino IDE (Tools > Serial Plotter)
- [ ] Open Processing and open (or copy/paste) the **Processing script**
- [ ] Make sure you close your Serial Plotter
- [ ] Run the Processing script and resolve potential errors

### 4. Run the tests
- [ ] The default measurement is to record maximum inflation pressure, but feel free to deviate from the default.
- [ ] Store the data in SPSS

### 5. Do the analysis, interpret and report
- [ ] Run the appropriate analysis
- [ ] Check if the hypothesis are confirmed
- [ ] Make an appropriate data visualization
- [ ] Bundle everything a slide-based report

## Creating floatables
We won't be using CNC techniques for this assignment. Instead, we will craft the floatables using a **soldering iron**. For best results, take a look at the optimal temperatures in the paper. It is advised to put a **cardboard underneath** your floatable and **aluminium foil on top** of it.  
  
 Be creative! Combine different materials, try crazy shapes, think of inspiring applications, ...
  
* For the sample: first draw your shapes with a marker on the aluminium foil. Then follow the contours with a soldering iron.  
* For mass production: first produce your shapes by lasercutting a piece of wood.
